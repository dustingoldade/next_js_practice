Use layouts at the top of a page to render items without triggering a rerender when children of that compoennt are updated via routes. 

Use <link> to ensure that new links do not trigger a full reload but just trigger an update of state... but also do not rerender the 
parent layout compoennt

children layout is basicailly a wrapper for everything in that directory

Use the Font file in the UI folder to import fonts into the app... This will prevent shifing when rendering the page. 

anything that requires a react hook, requires the component to use "use client" as it's rendered on the client side. 

to get the current url, you can use usePathname()
